RENDER FARM - WHAT HAPPENS AFTER INSTALLATION
================================================================

AFTER EXE INSTALLATION COMPLETES:
=================================

üñ•Ô∏è SERVER INSTALLATION CREATES:
-------------------------------
‚úÖ Installation folder with all server files:
   - main_app.py (main server application)
   - server.py (core server logic)
   - unified_app.py (combined interface)
   - distributed_renderers.py (render management)
   - worker_deployment_manager.py (worker control)
   - job_queue_manager.py (job handling)
   - All config files and dependencies

‚úÖ Launcher files:
   - Start_Server.bat (in install directory)
   - Render Farm Server.bat (on desktop)

‚úÖ Configuration:
   - server_config.json (server settings)
   - Database setup for job tracking

SERVER NEXT STEPS:
-----------------
1. Launch server using:
   - Desktop shortcut: "Render Farm Server.bat"
   - Or run: Start_Server.bat from install folder
   - Or click "Launch Server" in installer

2. Server starts and opens:
   - Web interface at http://localhost:8080
   - Command line interface showing status

3. Configure workers:
   - Access web interface
   - Go to "Worker Deployment" tab
   - Add worker machines
   - Deploy workers remotely (optional)

4. Submit render jobs:
   - Use web interface
   - Upload render files
   - Configure render settings
   - Start rendering across workers

================================================================

üë∑ WORKER INSTALLATION CREATES:
------------------------------
‚úÖ Installation folder with worker files:
   - worker_node.py (main worker application)
   - job_queue_manager.py (job handling)
   - All required dependencies

‚úÖ Launcher files:
   - Start_Worker.bat (in install directory)
   - Render Farm Worker.bat (on desktop)

‚úÖ Configuration:
   - worker_config.json (with server connection details)
   - Auto-connect settings

WORKER NEXT STEPS:
-----------------
1. Launch worker using:
   - Desktop shortcut: "Render Farm Worker.bat"
   - Or run: Start_Worker.bat from install folder
   - Or click "Launch Worker" in installer

2. Worker automatically:
   - Connects to specified server (IP:Port from installation)
   - Registers with server
   - Shows connection status

3. Worker starts processing:
   - Receives render jobs from server
   - Processes tasks automatically
   - Reports progress back to server

4. Monitor from server:
   - Check worker status in server web interface
   - View render progress
   - See performance metrics

================================================================

üöÄ TYPICAL SETUP WORKFLOW:
==========================

STEP 1: Install Server (Main Machine)
- Run installer, choose "Server"
- Launch server
- Note the server IP address

STEP 2: Install Workers (Render Machines)  
- Run installer on each machine, choose "Worker"
- Enter server IP during installation
- Launch workers

STEP 3: Start Rendering
- Submit jobs through server web interface
- Workers automatically pick up jobs
- Monitor progress in real-time
